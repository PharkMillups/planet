  "description": "<p>For some reason Google Reader has failed to update and include my latest <a href=\"http://buffered.io/2010/10/13/webmachine-erlydtl-and-riak-part-3/\">Web Development in Erlang</a> post. This is rather odd as every other RSS reader I have tested (including the one built-in to MS Outlook) has managed to parse and handle the post just fine. I have attempted to get in touch with the GReader team but I haven't had any luck so far in getting them to respond.</p>\n<p>Those of you who are using Google Reader and are interested in this post, please point your browser in <a href=\"http://buffered.io/2010/10/13/webmachine-erlydtl-and-riak-part-3/\">this direction</a>.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the issue.</p>",
